# Task 4: Infrastructure as Code

## Objective
Develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations to provision cloud resources for a containerized application.

## Requirements
1. Create Terraform (or similar IaC tool) configurations that:
   - Provision a Kubernetes cluster (or suitable container platform)
   - Configure networking components (VPC, subnets, security groups)
   - Set up a container registry
   - Implement proper resource tagging and naming
2. Ensure the infrastructure follows security best practices
3. Implement variables and outputs for reusability
4. Structure your code in a modular way
5. Include documentation on how to apply and destroy the infrastructure

## Starter Files
A basic directory structure is provided. Your task is to:
1. Review the requirements
2. Create the necessary Terraform configuration files
3. Document your solution in a SOLUTION.md file

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Architecture**: Is the infrastructure design appropriate?
- **Security**: Are security best practices followed?
- **Modularity**: Is the code structured in a reusable way?
- **Best Practices**: Does the configuration follow IaC best practices?
- **Documentation**: Is the solution well documented?

## Testing Your Solution
Since applying this infrastructure might incur costs, explain in your SOLUTION.md:
- How you would validate the Terraform configurations
- The expected resources that would be created
- Any prerequisites or assumptions made
- How to clean up resources after testing

## Timeframe
Recommended time: 60-90 minutes
