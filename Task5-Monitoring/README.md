# Task 5: Monitoring and Observability

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive monitoring and observability solution for a containerized application environment.

## Requirements
1. Set up a monitoring stack that includes:
   - Metrics collection and visualization
   - Logging aggregation
   - Distributed tracing
   - Alert configuration
2. Configure monitoring for:
   - Container-level metrics (CPU, memory, network)
   - Application-level metrics (requests, latency, errors)
   - Infrastructure metrics (if applicable)
3. Create meaningful dashboards
4. Implement alerting for critical conditions
5. Configure log aggregation and search capabilities

## Starter Files
A sample application and configuration templates are provided. Your task is to:
1. Review the application code
2. Configure the monitoring components
3. Integrate the monitoring agents with the application
4. Create appropriate dashboards and alerts
5. Document your solution in a SOLUTION.md file

## Technology Options
You may choose from the following technology stacks:
- Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Datadog
- New Relic
- Custom solution (if you prefer)

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness**: Does the solution cover metrics, logs, and traces?
- **Integration**: Is the monitoring properly integrated with the application?
- **Usability**: Are the dashboards informative and well-designed?
- **Alerting**: Are alerts configured for appropriate conditions?
- **Documentation**: Is the solution well documented?

## Testing Your Solution
To test your solution:
- Explain how to deploy your monitoring stack
- Provide examples of dashboard views
- Describe how to generate test load to trigger alerts
- Show how to query logs for specific events

## Timeframe
Recommended time: 45-60 minutes
