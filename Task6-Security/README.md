# Task 6: Security Challenge

## Objective
Identify and fix security vulnerabilities in a provided Docker deployment setup and implement best practices for container security.

## Requirements
1. Review and improve the provided Dockerfile and deployment configurations by:
   - Identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities
   - Implementing least privilege principles
   - Setting up proper secret management
   - Configuring network security policies
   - Implementing image scanning in the build process
2. Document all identified issues and your solutions
3. Implement secure CI/CD practices for container deployment
4. Add appropriate security monitoring

## Starter Files
A vulnerable application and deployment configuration are provided. Your task is to:
1. Review the provided files for security issues
2. Modify the configurations to fix all identified security issues
3. Add any necessary additional security measures
4. Document your findings and solutions in a SOLUTION.md file

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Did you identify all the security issues?
- **Remediation**: Are your fixes effective and following best practices?
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Did you implement multiple layers of security?
- **Documentation**: Is your security assessment comprehensive?
- **Best Practices**: Does your solution align with industry security standards?

## Testing Your Solution
To test your security improvements:
- Explain how you would verify each security fix
- Provide examples of security scanning tools used
- Document before/after comparison of security posture

## Timeframe
Recommended time: 45-60 minutes
